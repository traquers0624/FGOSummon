# FGOSummon

FGOSummon is a simple Python application that lets the user summon servants from the Fate/Grand Order mobile game's original roster of characters.
There are 2 ways to play, gacha summon and true summon.
Gacha summoning uses the following odds:
- 5 star: 10%
- 4 star: 15%
- 3 star: 20%
- 2 star: 25%
- 1 star: 30%

True summoning randomly selects a servant from the database, regardless of rarity level.
